# Real-time Proctoring Tool Build Plan

Progress through the six major steps will be tracked by updating the checkboxes below as each step is completed.

1. [x] **Step 1 – Audit current scaffolding:** Review existing backend/frontend codebases and compare them with the requirements in `prompt/description1.md` to enumerate missing features.
2. [x] **Step 2 – Design backend architecture:** Define FastAPI routes, Socket.IO events, in-memory data structures, and WebRTC signalling responsibilities that satisfy the spec.
3. [x] **Step 3 – Implement backend core:** Build room management, lobby updates, signalling helpers, and lifecycle controls according to the architecture plan.
4. [ ] **Step 4 – Scaffold frontend:** Create the Vite/React project, routing, layout, and shared state foundation aligned with the UX flow (landing → lobby → room).
5. [ ] **Step 5 – Implement frontend flows:** Develop landing form validation, realtime lobby updates, role-aware room grids, and screen-sharing UX.
6. [ ] **Step 6 – Integrate WebRTC & polish:** Connect backend/frontend signalling, ensure video hover previews and host controls work, and perform manual validation.

This checklist will be updated (ticking the boxes) as each step is completed.
